# 🚢 Optimal Ship Routing

## 🌊 Why this project exists

Most of the world’s trade floats on the backs of ships. They carry everything from bananas to cars — across oceans that can be unpredictable, expensive, and dangerous. Every mile matters: longer routes burn more fuel, cost more money, and leave a bigger carbon footprint.

This project is about helping ships find **better paths across the sea**: faster when it matters, safer when storms threaten, and cleaner for the planet.

---

## ✨ What this does

* **Finds smarter routes** – not just shortest, but balanced for time, fuel, and safety.
* **Thinks about the ocean** – considers weather, currents, and rough seas.
* **Cuts fuel use** – saving money and reducing emissions.
* **Stays fast** – built to scale for multiple ships and routes.
* **Can grow** – room for maps, dashboards, and fleet-level insights.

## 🚀 How to use it

Clone this repo and hop inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimal-ship-routing.git
cd optimal-ship-routing
```

Install the stuff it needs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a route:

```bash
python src/routing.py --origin "Singapore" --destination "Rotterdam" --fuel-efficient
```

---

## 🧭 Example run

Say we’re sending a ship from Singapore to Rotterdam. We tell the algorithm to avoid storms and save fuel.

Output might look like:

```
Route Found: 12,340 nautical miles  
Estimated Time: 27 days  
Fuel Saved: ~15%  
```

That’s real savings — for wallets *and* the atmosphere.
